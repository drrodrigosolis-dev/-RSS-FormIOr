\title{Clean duplicated rows caused by multi-value fields in flattened FormIO data}
\usage{
FixDups(
  x,
  multi_counts = NULL,
  id_col = 1,
  ask_threshold = 1.05,
  quiet = FALSE,
  dry_run = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{List returned by \code{\link[=FlattenSubmissions]{FlattenSubmissions()}}, must contain \verb{$FlatResponses}}

\item{multi_counts}{Optional. Output from \code{\link[=findMultilines]{findMultilines()}}. If \code{NULL},
it is computed automatically.}

\item{id_col}{Character or integer. Name or position of the submission ID
column (usually \code{"submissionId"} or column 1). Default: 1.}

\item{ask_threshold}{Numeric. Only prompt about columns where the maximum
number of distinct values per submission exceeds this value.
Default = 1.05 (catches almost all real multiples while ignoring noise).}

\item{quiet}{Logical. Suppress most messages and summaries? Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{dry_run}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, shows what would happen without actually
modifying the data. Default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\describe{
\item{cleaned}{A tibble containing the cleaned, deduplicated responses}
\item{decisions}{A tibble recording which strategy was applied (or if
the column was removed) for each processed column}
}
}
\description{
Interactive function designed for users with little or no R experience.
It helps resolve columns that contain multiple values per submission
(e.g. repeating sections, "add another" items, multi-select questions).
}
\details{
Shows a summary of problematic columns first, then asks the user one column
at a time how to handle each one (concatenate, keep first, sum, count,
remove the column entirely, etc.).

Most strategies reduce the data to one row per submission.
Choosing "remove" drops the column completely from the output.
All decisions are logged so you can review or reproduce the cleaning steps.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Typical workflow
responses <- GetResponses(form_id = "your-form-id", api_key = "your-api-key")
flat <- FlattenSubmissions(responses)

# Run interactive cleaning
result <- FixDups(flat)

# View the cleaned data
View(result$cleaned)

# See what was done to each column
result$decisions

# Dry run to preview changes
FixDups(flat, dry_run = TRUE)
}
