\usage{
GetFormMetadata(
  base_url = "https://submit.digital.gov.bc.ca/app/api/v1",
  form_id = NULL,
  api_key = NULL,
  reenter.credentials = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_url}{URL where the form is stored. for the Gov't of BC, the URL is "https://submit.digital.gov.bc.ca/app/api/v1"(default)}

\item{form_id}{if left  (Default), and credentials have not been entered, it will run AskCredentials() to obtain the information. You can find your Form's ID by going to your Form Settings page, and copying it from the URL (after the "=" sign in the URL)}

\item{api_key}{if left  (Default), and credentials have not been entered, it will run AskCredentials() to obtain the information. You can generate an API for the specific form from the "Manage Form" page}

\item{reenter.credentials}{Default as FALSE. if TRUE, it will ask you to reenter the Form ID and API KEY, regardless if they already exist in the system}
}
\value{
A named, hierarchical list representing the configuration and metadata of a
survey form. The list contains a mix of scalar elements (character, logical,
and numeric), nested sublists, and embedded data frames. Top-level elements
include form metadata (e.g., name, description, identifiers, deployment
settings), feature flags, and ownership information. Nested components
describe structured configuration domains such as scheduling rules
(\code{schedule}), external metadata (\code{formMetadata}), and event streaming
configuration (\code{eventStreamConfig}). Version history and identity provider
information are returned as data frames within the list. The structure
mirrors the hierarchical JSON schema returned by the underlying API while
using native R data types for programmatic access.

#' @details
The function returns a hierarchical named list representing the full survey
form configuration. Top-level elements include scalar metadata fields such as
the form name, description, identifiers, and feature flags. Nested sublists
encode structured configuration blocks (e.g., scheduling rules and event
stream configuration), and selected components (e.g., versions and identity
providers) are returned as data frames. The structure closely mirrors the
original JSON response from the API while using native R data types.
